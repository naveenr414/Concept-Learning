# Concept Hierarchies for Concept Learning Methods

![Concept Hierarchies](figures/pull_figure.png)

This repository contains the implementation for the thesis "Concept Hierarchies for Concept Learning Methods", for the Masters in Philosophy course at Cambridge University.

This work was done by [Naveen Raman](https://naveenraman.com/)

#### TL;DR
We construct concept hierarchies, a way to capture concept-concept relationships in concept models. These hierarchies provide a qualitative visual summary of a model, while being stable across iterations and robust to noise. Additionally, concept hierarchies assist with downstream applications include concept intervention and classification. 

We provide code here to perform the following operations: 
1. Construct concept hierarchies and concept vectors
2. Evaluate concept hierarchies
3. Employ concept hierarchies for concept intervention and classification

We provide the bulk of the code in this repository. However, to run concept interventions, we provide information in the scripts/cem_scripts folder. 

## Installation and Datasets
